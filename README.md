# IES Project
## Project Abstract
This project was developed during the course of Introduction to Software Engineering as the final course project and its goal is to design a web and/or mobile app that has the user experience in mind, providing a fast and enjoyable way of browsing and acquiring tickets. That being said, we’ŕe aiming to develop an app that lists available movies and cinemas to the user, so that they can check movies plot and information as well as schedules and be able to buy tickets for various movie sessions. In addition we also provide a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to manage their bought tickets via a developed API. Furthermore a cinema owner can also create a page for its own cinema and add the movies in display, add schedules as well as room info and seats.
